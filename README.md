The aim of this research is to analyze the various trends and distributions among popular movies and tv shows along with a sentiment analysis of the reviews for them. Considering the number of movies and tv shows spread throughout the years along with their popularity, ratings, genres and various other intrinsic factors, we have created visualizations for better understanding of what the current trends have been. Along with this, a sentiment analysis of the various reviews were considered which was divided into positive and negative reviews and a visual study was conducted to find comparisons between these two modes of entertainment. A notable finding was that there is no correlation of the ratings and the popularity of movies as well as tv shows along with the fact that movies and tv shows released very recently have more popularity than others. In terms of the sentiment analysis of reviews for these popular movies and tv shows, the most number of popular tv shows is in the Drama genre, but it also has the most number of negative reviews.
